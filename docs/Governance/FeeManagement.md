# Fee Management

## Fee Distribution

10% of the staking fees are taken and distributed across the Lido stakeholders. That 10% is distributed in the following manner:

- Insurance Fund: a% (of the 10%)
- Treasury Fund: b%
- Chorus One Fund: c%
- Validator Fund: d%

> Note: For the validator fund, this is distributed equally across the current (for that epoch) list of validators.

**All fees are distributed in the form of stSOL**
